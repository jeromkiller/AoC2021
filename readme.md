# Advent of code 2021
These are my sollutions to AoC 2021.
### language used ```C```
___
In these sollutions I'll be trying to get better at using ```C```  by trying different standard functions and attempting to write my own parsing functions.


### Hi there,
___
This is my first year participating in this event.
So I don't know if I can finnish all puzzles on time, or at all...

But i'll be trying my best to keep up.

The solutions are probably a bit hacky.


## building it yourself:
---
Run the ```make``` command to build any of the solutions
 

## benchmarks:
---
Benchmarks are ran with hyperfine
Code is run on an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 at around 3.95Ghz inside WSL so there might be some overhead gumming up the results
