# Advent of code 2021
These are my sollutions to AoC 2021.
### language used ```C```
___
In these sollutions I'll be trying to get better at using ```C```  by trying different standard functions and attempting to write my own parsing functions.


### Hi there,
___
This is my first year participating in this event.
So I don't know if I can finnish all puzzles on time, or at all...

But i'll be trying my best to keep up.

The solutions are probably a bit hacky, but i hope that might save space or speed it up.
When i get benchmarks running I'll probably attempt to improve the solutions.

## benchmarks:
I'll put these up when I figure out how to reasonably benchmark :P
